# Portfolio

# Introduction
These examples featured in my portfolio are individual assignments that I personally coded, demonstrating my proficiency and hands-on experience in various IT-related projects. There is a zip file that contains my Final Year Project (FYP) source codes. However, its contents are too big that GitHub cannot show. If you are interested in the source codes, you can click on FYP-23-S3-27_SourceCode.zip and click "view raw" to download it.
